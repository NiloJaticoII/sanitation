# sanitation
This is my first C# project application that uses .NET framework.

## Classes
There are three classes in the project.
1. Dispenser - A dispenser class that has a unique identifier and the capacity for sanitation.
2. Person - A class that contains the name and the boolean if the person is clean or not.
3. Program - Entry point for the program to start running.
